# School-Project

I undertook several computer science projects during my M.S. at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon, which enhanced various skills, including object-oriented programming, structured algorithms, graphic interface design, and web development. All these projects were implemented using Python. Here is a list of the most relevant projects I worked on:

- Image Compression 
- Automatic Change
- Hangman Game
- Hotel Management
